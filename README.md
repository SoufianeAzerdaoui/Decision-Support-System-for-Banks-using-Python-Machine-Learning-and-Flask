# Process Overview

## Data Collection and Preparation
Data was collected from Kaggle, a platform hosting datasets relevant to various industries. Subsequently, the collected data underwent cleaning and preprocessing to ensure its suitability for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
A comprehensive exploratory analysis was conducted to uncover meaningful insights, trends, and correlations within the data. This stage aimed to provide a deeper understanding of the underlying patterns pertinent to credit approval.

## Machine Learning Model Development
Multiple machine learning models were developed and evaluated to predict credit approval. These models were trained and fine-tuned using the prepared dataset, with a focus on optimizing predictive performance.

## Deployment using Flask
The final machine learning model was deployed into a Flask web application. This deployment allowed users to conveniently interact with the system by submitting their information and receiving instant estimations of their credit approval status.
